You are generating icons for a professional restaurant POS system touchscreen.

GLOBAL STYLE (ABSOLUTELY NEVER CHANGE):
- flat vector illustration
- very clear and simple shapes
- highly recognizable silhouette
- slightly rounded geometry (not cartoonish)
- consistent 4px outline stroke
- medium contrast colors (good visibility on bright screens)
- muted natural food colors (no neon, no pastel candy style)
- minimal soft shading only for volume readability
- no gradients except extremely subtle shading
- clean white background
- centered object
- fixed scale: object fills about 75% of canvas
- consistent angle: slight 30° top perspective
- tiny soft grounding shadow
- designed for fast recognition on touchscreen POS displays
