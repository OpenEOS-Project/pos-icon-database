You are generating icons for a professional restaurant POS system touchscreen.

GLOBAL STYLE (ABSOLUTELY NEVER CHANGE):
- flat vector illustration
- clean commercial UI icon style
- clear readable silhouette
- slightly rounded geometry (not cartoonish)
- consistent 4px outline stroke
- medium contrast natural colors
- realistic food coloration but simplified shapes
- stylized internal details (foam, seeds, bubbles, texture hints)
- minimal soft shading only to separate surfaces
- no realistic lighting
- no material rendering
- no painterly shading
- no gradients except extremely subtle shading

BACKGROUND RULES:

- the transparency must exist ONLY outside the object silhouette
- the object itself must be fully opaque
- no semi-transparent materials
- no real glass transparency
- liquids and glass must be drawn using light colors, not transparency
- no holes or cutouts inside the object

LAYOUT:
- centered object
- object fills about 75% of canvas
- consistent angle: slight 30° top perspective
- tiny soft grounding shadow directly under object

STRICT RULES:
